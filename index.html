                        (World
                        Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple
                        single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps),
                        electronic
                        businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web
                        development
                        commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client
                        liaison,
                        client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
                        development.<br>
                        Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design
                        aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content
                        management
                        systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.<br>
                        For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds
                        of people (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing
                        websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or
                        secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems
                        technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the
                        domain of
                        a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end
                        developer,
                        back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior
                        and
                        visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products you
                are offering, understand why your products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and
                see which of your company's qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with
                high-quality images and thought-out presentation will have a large influence on customers, and it is
                important to strive towards making your product as relatable and appealing as possible. Additionally,
                with website development you can:
                <ol>
                    <li>Communicate with your visitors effectively. Interacting with your audience is vital when it
                        comes to generating more business. It is viable to make a website that enables you to get in
                        touch with your customers and prospects, and you can produce valuable content for the audience
                        associated with the industry or business you're in. Afterwards, post the content on your blog,
                        share it on social media networks and respond to customers' comments and feedback promptly. This
                        will show your clients the extent to which youâ€™re concerned about their satisfaction and
                        responsive to their needs.</li>
                    <li>Improve your connectivity. A website will facilitate things like expanding your reach and
                        attracting more visitors to your business. Planning to make a responsive website design for your
                        site will help make it accessible to an extensive range of users spanning several devices, such
                        as tablets or smartphones. This will increase both your site's exposure and organic traffic.
                    </li>
                    <li> Prove your reliability. A website offers a straightforward method of showing the credibility of
                        a business, and the way a person represents his business online is vital for attracting more
                        customers or visitors. Therefore, your website design should be handled in the best possible
                        way, because a professional presentation speaks volumes as testimony to your business. With the
                        help of website development, you can add your skills, credentials, experience, expertise and
                        more in a single place. These details help you earn the trust and confidence of your visitors
                        and serve as a reference point for customers interested in your business, making it easy for you
                        to produce leads.</li>
